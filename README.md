# NERC CIP – Intent Summary (Reference Only)

---

## Purpose

This document summarizes the **intent and risk themes** reflected in NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards.

It exists **only** to inform contract drafting and vendor risk controls for microgrid projects.

This document:
- Is **not** a NERC standard
- Is **not** a compliance guide
- Does **not** determine applicability
- Does **not** interpret or map CIP requirements

Use this summary as a **reference for risk themes**, not as a mandate.

## Scope and Limitations

This summary applies only to:
- Contractual controls
- Vendor obligations
- Design and access decisions

This summary does **not**:
- Assert CIP applicability
- Require compliance or certification
- Replace legal or regulatory review
- Define technical controls or implementations

## Core Risk Themes Reflected in NERC CIP

NERC CIP broadly emphasizes control of risk in the following areas.

### Design Authority
- Who has authority to design systems that affect control, protection, or connectivity
- Clear ownership of architecture decisions
- Accountability for design choices that introduce exposure

### Access Control
- Limiting who can access systems
- Avoiding shared or unmanaged access
- Ensuring access is approved, known, and revocable

### External Connectivity
- Understanding what systems connect externally
- Identifying trust boundaries
- Controlling remote and vendor access paths

### Change Control
- Knowing when systems or configurations change
- Preventing unauthorized or undocumented changes
- Maintaining approved configurations

### Vendor and Supply Chain Risk
- Recognizing that third parties introduce risk
- Managing vendor access and design influence contractually
- Requiring transparency around third-party dependencies

### Evidence and Documentation
- Documented architecture and connectivity
- Retained records of approvals and changes
- Ability to demonstrate informed decisions

## Assumptions Reflected in CIP Intent

CIP assumes, at a minimum, that asset owners:
- Know who has access to systems
- Understand system boundaries and interfaces
- Control design decisions that affect exposure
- Retain documentation of architecture and changes
- Can remove access when relationships end

These assumptions inform contractual expectations.

## Currency and Maintenance

This document reflects the **general intent of NERC CIP as of the time it was last updated**.

It should be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect material changes in:
- NERC CIP focus areas
